    "### The Importance of the Standard Library\n",
    "Python is often described as coming with \"batteries included,\" which is usually a reference to its standard library. The Python standard library is vast, unlike any other language in the tech world. The Python standard library includes modules to connect to a socket; that is, one to send emails, one to connect to SQLite, one to work with the locale module, or one to encode and decode JSON and XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also renowned for including such modules as turtle and tkinter, graphical interfaces that most users probably don't use anymore, but they have proven useful when Python is taught at schools and universities.\n",
    "\n",
    "It even includes IDLE, a Python-integrated development environment, it is not widely used as there are either other packages within the standard library that are used more often or external tools to substitute them. These libraries are divided into high-level modules and lower-level modules:"

You can open an interpreter and run the following code snippet to print graphics on the screen. This can be executed on the Python terminal. The code mentioned here is with the >>> symbol:\n",

    "This code uses the turtle module which can be used to print the output on the screen. This output will look like the trail of a turtle that follows when the cursor is moved. The turtle module allows the user to interact with the cursor and leave a trail as it keeps moving. It has functions to move around the screen and print as it advances.\n",

    "It then rotates it 180 degrees to the right.\n",
    "It moves forward 100 pixels, painting as it walks.\n",

Good examples are the different internet protocol modules, text formatting and templating, interacting with C code, testing, serving HTTP sites, and so on. The standard library comes with low-level modules to satisfy the needs of users in many of those scenarios, but you will usually see Python developers relying on libraries such as jinja2, requests, flask, cython, and cffi that are built on top of the low-level standard library module as they provide a nicer, simpler, more powerful interface. It is not that you cannot create an extension with the C API or ctypes, but cython allows you to remove a lot of the boilerplate, whereas the standard library requires you to write and optimize the most common scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is another type of low-level module, which extends or simplifies the language. Notable examples of these are the following:\n",

    "- Typing: To type hinting\n",
    "- Contextvar: To save state based on the context\n",

    "- Doctest: To verify code examples in documentation and docstrings\n",
    "- Pdb and bdb: To access debugging tools\n",

    "#### Set and Dictionary Comprehensions\n",
    "List comprehensions are handy ways to concisely build sequences of values in Python. Other forms of comprehensions are also available, which you can use to build other collection types. A set is an unordered collection: you can see what elements are in a set, but you cannot index into a set nor insert an object at a particular location in the set because the elements are not ordered. An element can only be present in a set once, whereas it could appear in a list multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are frequently useful in situations where you want to quickly test whether an object is in a collection but do not need to track the order of the objects in the collection. For example, a web service might keep track of all of the active session tokens in a set, so that when it receives a request, it can test whether the session token corresponds to an active session.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary is a collection of pairs of objects, where one object in the pair is called the key, and the other is called the value. In this case, you associate a value with a particular key, and then you can ask the dictionary for the value associated with that key. Each key may only be present in a dictionary once, but multiple keys may be associated with the same value. While the name \"dictionary\" suggests a connection between terms and their definitions, dictionaries are commonly used as indices (and, therefore, a dictionary comprehension is often used to build an index). Going back to your web service example, different users of the service could have different permissions, thus limiting the actions that they can perform. The web service could construct a dictionary in which the keys are session tokens, and the values represent user permissions. This is so that it can quickly tell whether a request associated with a given session is permissible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for both set and dictionary comprehensions looks very similar to list comprehension, with the square brackets ([]) simply replaced by curly braces ({}). The difference between the two is how the elements are described. For a set, you need to indicate a single element, for example, { x for x in … }. For a dictionary, you need to indicate a pair containing the key and the value, for example, { key:value for key in… }"

    "Iterators are useful for describing sequences, such as Python lists and ranges, and sequence-like collections, such as your own data types, that provide ordered access to their contents. Iterators make it easy to work with these types in a Pythonic way. Python's library includes the itertools module, which has a selection of helpful functions for combining, manipulating, and otherwise working with iterators. In this section, you will use a couple of helpful tools from the module. There are plenty more available, so be sure to check out the official documentation for itertools.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the important uses of itertools is in dealing with infinite sequences. There are plenty of situations in which a sequence does not have an end: everything from infinite series in mathematics to the event loop in a graphical application. A graphical user interface is usually built around an event loop in which the program waits for an event (such as a keypress, a mouse click, a timer expiring, or something else) and then reacts to it. The stream of events can be treated as a potentially infinite list of event objects, with the program taking the next event object from the sequence and doing its reaction work. Iterating over such a sequence with either a Python for..in loop or a comprehension will never terminate. There are functions in itertools for providing a window onto an infinite sequence, and the following exercise will look at one of those."

Using a generator allows the program to pass control back and forth between the I/O stream when data is available, and the caller where the data can be processed.\n",

    "Python internally turns generator functions into objects that use the iterator protocol (such as __iter__, __next__, and the StopIteration error), so the work you put into understanding iterations in the previous section means you already know what generators are doing. There is nothing you can write for a generator that could not be replaced with an equivalent iterator object. However, sometimes, a generator is easier to write or understand. Writing code that is easier to understand is the definition of Pythonicity."

    "Regular expressions (or regexes) are a domain-specific programming language, defining a grammar for expressing efficient and flexible string comparisons. Introduced in 1951 by Stephen Cole Kleene, regular expressions have become a popular tool for searching and manipulating text. As an example, if you're writing a text editor and you want to highlight all web links in a document and make them clickable, you might search for strings that start with HTTP or HTTPS, then those that contain ://, and then those that contain some collection of printable characters, until you stop finding printable characters (such as a space, newline, or the end of the text), and highlight everything up to the end. With standard Python syntax, this will be possible, but you will end up with a very complex loop that will be difficult to get right. Using regexes, you match against https?://\\S+."

We use the \\S character class. Other character classes include \\w (word characters), \\W (non-word characters), and \\d (digits).\n",
    "- Two quantifiers are used: ? means \"0 or 1 time,\" so \"s?\" means \"match if the text does not have s at this point or has it exactly once.\" The quantifier, +, means \"1 or more times,\" so \"\\S+\" says \"one or more non-whitespace characters.\" There is also a quantifier *, meaning \"0 or more times.\"Additional regex features that you will use in this chapter are listed here:\n",
    "- Parentheses () introduce a numbered sub-expression, sometimes called a \"capture group.\" They are numbered from 1, in the order that they appear in the expression.\n",
    "- A backslash followed by a number refers to a numbered sub-expression, described previously. As an example, \\1 refers to the first sub-expression. These can be used when replacing text that matches the regex or to store part of a regex to use later in the same expression. Because of the way that backslashes are interpreted by Python strings, this is written as \\\\1 in a Python regex.\n",

If the function is imported from another module, you will have to pass the full function specification, for example, break html.parser. HTMLParser.reset, to stop at the reset function of the HTMLParser class of html.parser.\n",

    "- list: This displays 11 lines of code from the point where the execution stopped for the first time to when it is called. Successive calls to list will display the following lines in batches of 11. To start again from where the execution stopped, use list.\n",
    "- longlist: This shows the source code of the current function in the current frame that is being executed.\n",
    "- next: This executes the line and moves to the following one.\n",
    "- step: This executes the current line and stops at the first opportunity within the function being executed. This is useful when you don't want to just execute a function, but we want to step through it.\n",
