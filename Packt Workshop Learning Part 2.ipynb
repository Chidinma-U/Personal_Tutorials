    "### The Importance of the Standard Library\n",
    "Python is often described as coming with \"batteries included,\" which is usually a reference to its standard library. The Python standard library is vast, unlike any other language in the tech world. The Python standard library includes modules to connect to a socket; that is, one to send emails, one to connect to SQLite, one to work with the locale module, or one to encode and decode JSON and XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also renowned for including such modules as turtle and tkinter, graphical interfaces that most users probably don't use anymore, but they have proven useful when Python is taught at schools and universities.\n",
    "\n",
    "It even includes IDLE, a Python-integrated development environment, it is not widely used as there are either other packages within the standard library that are used more often or external tools to substitute them. These libraries are divided into high-level modules and lower-level modules:"

You can open an interpreter and run the following code snippet to print graphics on the screen. This can be executed on the Python terminal. The code mentioned here is with the >>> symbol:\n",

    "This code uses the turtle module which can be used to print the output on the screen. This output will look like the trail of a turtle that follows when the cursor is moved. The turtle module allows the user to interact with the cursor and leave a trail as it keeps moving. It has functions to move around the screen and print as it advances.\n",

    "It then rotates it 180 degrees to the right.\n",
    "It moves forward 100 pixels, painting as it walks.\n",

Good examples are the different internet protocol modules, text formatting and templating, interacting with C code, testing, serving HTTP sites, and so on. The standard library comes with low-level modules to satisfy the needs of users in many of those scenarios, but you will usually see Python developers relying on libraries such as jinja2, requests, flask, cython, and cffi that are built on top of the low-level standard library module as they provide a nicer, simpler, more powerful interface. It is not that you cannot create an extension with the C API or ctypes, but cython allows you to remove a lot of the boilerplate, whereas the standard library requires you to write and optimize the most common scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is another type of low-level module, which extends or simplifies the language. Notable examples of these are the following:\n",

    "- Typing: To type hinting\n",
    "- Contextvar: To save state based on the context\n",

    "- Doctest: To verify code examples in documentation and docstrings\n",
    "- Pdb and bdb: To access debugging tools\n",

    "#### Set and Dictionary Comprehensions\n",
    "List comprehensions are handy ways to concisely build sequences of values in Python. Other forms of comprehensions are also available, which you can use to build other collection types. A set is an unordered collection: you can see what elements are in a set, but you cannot index into a set nor insert an object at a particular location in the set because the elements are not ordered. An element can only be present in a set once, whereas it could appear in a list multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are frequently useful in situations where you want to quickly test whether an object is in a collection but do not need to track the order of the objects in the collection. For example, a web service might keep track of all of the active session tokens in a set, so that when it receives a request, it can test whether the session token corresponds to an active session.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary is a collection of pairs of objects, where one object in the pair is called the key, and the other is called the value. In this case, you associate a value with a particular key, and then you can ask the dictionary for the value associated with that key. Each key may only be present in a dictionary once, but multiple keys may be associated with the same value. While the name \"dictionary\" suggests a connection between terms and their definitions, dictionaries are commonly used as indices (and, therefore, a dictionary comprehension is often used to build an index). Going back to your web service example, different users of the service could have different permissions, thus limiting the actions that they can perform. The web service could construct a dictionary in which the keys are session tokens, and the values represent user permissions. This is so that it can quickly tell whether a request associated with a given session is permissible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for both set and dictionary comprehensions looks very similar to list comprehension, with the square brackets ([]) simply replaced by curly braces ({}). The difference between the two is how the elements are described. For a set, you need to indicate a single element, for example, { x for x in … }. For a dictionary, you need to indicate a pair containing the key and the value, for example, { key:value for key in… }"

    "Iterators are useful for describing sequences, such as Python lists and ranges, and sequence-like collections, such as your own data types, that provide ordered access to their contents. Iterators make it easy to work with these types in a Pythonic way. Python's library includes the itertools module, which has a selection of helpful functions for combining, manipulating, and otherwise working with iterators. In this section, you will use a couple of helpful tools from the module. There are plenty more available, so be sure to check out the official documentation for itertools.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the important uses of itertools is in dealing with infinite sequences. There are plenty of situations in which a sequence does not have an end: everything from infinite series in mathematics to the event loop in a graphical application. A graphical user interface is usually built around an event loop in which the program waits for an event (such as a keypress, a mouse click, a timer expiring, or something else) and then reacts to it. The stream of events can be treated as a potentially infinite list of event objects, with the program taking the next event object from the sequence and doing its reaction work. Iterating over such a sequence with either a Python for..in loop or a comprehension will never terminate. There are functions in itertools for providing a window onto an infinite sequence, and the following exercise will look at one of those."

Using a generator allows the program to pass control back and forth between the I/O stream when data is available, and the caller where the data can be processed.\n",

    "Python internally turns generator functions into objects that use the iterator protocol (such as __iter__, __next__, and the StopIteration error), so the work you put into understanding iterations in the previous section means you already know what generators are doing. There is nothing you can write for a generator that could not be replaced with an equivalent iterator object. However, sometimes, a generator is easier to write or understand. Writing code that is easier to understand is the definition of Pythonicity."

    "Regular expressions (or regexes) are a domain-specific programming language, defining a grammar for expressing efficient and flexible string comparisons. Introduced in 1951 by Stephen Cole Kleene, regular expressions have become a popular tool for searching and manipulating text. As an example, if you're writing a text editor and you want to highlight all web links in a document and make them clickable, you might search for strings that start with HTTP or HTTPS, then those that contain ://, and then those that contain some collection of printable characters, until you stop finding printable characters (such as a space, newline, or the end of the text), and highlight everything up to the end. With standard Python syntax, this will be possible, but you will end up with a very complex loop that will be difficult to get right. Using regexes, you match against https?://\\S+."

We use the \\S character class. Other character classes include \\w (word characters), \\W (non-word characters), and \\d (digits).\n",
    "- Two quantifiers are used: ? means \"0 or 1 time,\" so \"s?\" means \"match if the text does not have s at this point or has it exactly once.\" The quantifier, +, means \"1 or more times,\" so \"\\S+\" says \"one or more non-whitespace characters.\" There is also a quantifier *, meaning \"0 or more times.\"Additional regex features that you will use in this chapter are listed here:\n",
    "- Parentheses () introduce a numbered sub-expression, sometimes called a \"capture group.\" They are numbered from 1, in the order that they appear in the expression.\n",
    "- A backslash followed by a number refers to a numbered sub-expression, described previously. As an example, \\1 refers to the first sub-expression. These can be used when replacing text that matches the regex or to store part of a regex to use later in the same expression. Because of the way that backslashes are interpreted by Python strings, this is written as \\\\1 in a Python regex.\n",

If the function is imported from another module, you will have to pass the full function specification, for example, break html.parser. HTMLParser.reset, to stop at the reset function of the HTMLParser class of html.parser.\n",

    "- where: This prints a stack trace with the current line of execution where the debugger stopped. It is useful to know what called this function or to be able to move around the stack.\n",
    "- down and up: These two commands allow us to move around in the stack. If we are in a function call, we can use up to move to the caller of the function and inspect the state in that frame, or you can use down to go deeper in the stack after we have moved up.\n",
    "- list: This displays 11 lines of code from the point where the execution stopped for the first time to when it is called. Successive calls to list will display the following lines in batches of 11. To start again from where the execution stopped, use list.\n",
    "- longlist: This shows the source code of the current function in the current frame that is being executed.\n",
    "- next: This executes the line and moves to the following one.\n",
    "- step: This executes the current line and stops at the first opportunity within the function being executed. This is useful when you don't want to just execute a function, but we want to step through it.\n",
    "- p: This prints the value of an expression. It is useful for checking the content of variables.\n",
    "- pp: This allows you to pretty print an expression. It is useful for when we are trying to print long structures.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Understand the problem by asking the right questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to fully understand the issue, evaluate whether there is an issue with the source code, and to get all the possible data. You need to ask the user who reported the error, and ourselves, common questions such as the following indent question list:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What version of the software were they using?\n",
    "\n",
    "- When did the error happen for the first time?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Has it worked before?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is it an intermittent failure, or can the user consistently reproduce it?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What was the input of the program when the issue manifested?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the output and what would be the expected output?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do we have any logs or any other information to help us debug the issue?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this instance, you get to know that this happened with the last version of our script and the person who reported it could reproduce it. It seems to be happening only to Rose, but that might be related to the arguments she is providing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, she reported that her current salary is $1,000,000. She was told she would get a 30 % $ raise, and even if she is aware that managers earning that much get a penalty of 10%, as the company had a good year and she was a high earner, she was expecting a 10% bonus, which should amount to 30%. But she saw that her new salary was $1,200,000, rather than $1,300,000.\n",

    "You can translate this into the following arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "salary: 1,000,000.\n",

    "2. Reproduce the issue by running the calculate_new_salary function and the known arguments.\n",

    "#### Automated Testing\n",
    "Even though you explored and learned how to debug applications when errors are reported, you would prefer not having to find errors in our applications. To increase the chances of having a bug-free code base, most developers rely on automated testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of their careers, most developers will just manually test their code as they develop it. By just providing a set of inputs and verifying the output of the program, you can get a basic level of confidence that our code \"works.\" But this quickly becomes tedious and does not scale as the code base grows and evolves. Automated testing allows you to record a series of steps and stimuli that you perform in our code and have a series of expected output recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is extremely efficient to reduce the number of bugs in our code base, because not only are we verifying the code, but we are also implementing it, and you keep a record of all those verifications for future modifications of the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of test lines that you write for each line of code really depends on each application. There are notorious cases, such as SQLite, where orders of magnitude more lines of tests are needed than lines of code, which greatly improves confidence in the software and allows quick release of new versions as features are added without needing the extensive quality assurance (QA) that other systems might require.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated testing is similar to the QA process that we see in other engineering fields. It is a key step of all software development and should be taken into account when developing a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, having automated tests also helps you to troubleshoot, as we have a set of test scenarios that you can adapt to simulate the user's input and environment and keep what is known as a regression test (not to be confused with Regression mentioned in Machine Learning course. Regression testing is performed whenever there is a code change and it verifies whether the cases that were working earlier are still working in the same manner after the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Test Categorization\n",
    "One of the first things to think about when writing an automated test is \"What are we verifying?\". And that would depend on the \"level\" of testing that you are doing. There is a lot of literature about how to categorize different test scenarios in the functions that they validate and the corresponding dependencies they have. It is not the same to write a test that just validates a simple Python function in our source code, as it is to write something that validates an accounting system that connects to the internet and sends emails. To validate large systems, it is common to create different types of tests. They are usually known as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unit tests: These are tests that just validate a small part of your code. Usually, they just validate a function with specific inputs within one of your files and only depend on code that has already been validated with other unit tests.\n",
    "- System Integration tests (SIT): These are more coarse-grained tests that will either validate interactions between different components of your codebase (known as integration tests without environment) or the interactions between your code and other systems and the environment (known as integration tests with the environment).\n",
    "- Functional or end-to-end tests / User Acceptance Testing (UAT): These are usually really high-level tests that depend on the environment and often on external systems that validate the solution with inputs as the user provides them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say that you were to test the workings of Twitter, using the tests you are familiar with:\n",
    "\n",
    "A unit test would verify one of the functions, which will check whether a tweet body is shorter than a specific length.\n",
    "An integration test would validate that, when a tweet is injected into the system, the trigger to other users is called.\n",
    "An end-to-end test is one that ensures that, when a user writes a tweet and clicks Send, they can then see it on their home page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software developers tend to prefer unit tests as they don't have external dependencies and are more stable and faster to run. The further we go into more coarse-grained tests, the more we'll come across what the user will perform, but both integration and end-to-end tests usually take much longer to run, as the dependencies need to be set up and they are usually flakier because, for example, the email server might not be working on that day, meaning we would be unable to run our tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This categorization is a simplification of many experts working in the field. If you are interested in the different levels of testing and getting the right balance of tests, then a good place to start is the famous Testing Pyramid.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Test Coverage\n",
    "Something that generates debate across the community is test coverage. When you write tests for our code, you start to exercise it and begin to hit different code paths. As you write more tests, we cover more and more of the code that you are testing. The percentage of code that you test is known as test coverage, and developers will argue that different percentages are \"the right amount.\" Getting to 100% coverage might seem an unnecessary task, but it proves to be quite useful in large codebases that need to perform tasks such as migrating from Python 2 to Python 3. However, this all depends on how much you are willing to invest in testing your application, and each developer might target a different number for each of the projects that they run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, something important to remember is that 100% coverage does not mean that your code does not have bugs. You can write tests that exercise your code but do not properly validate it, so be mindful of falling into the trap of just writing tests to hit the coverage target. Tests should be written to exercise the code with inputs that will be provided by users and try to find edge cases that can uncover issues with the assumptions that you made at the time that you wrote it, and not just to hit a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Writing Tests in Python with Unit Testing\n",
    "The Python standard library comes with a module, unittest, to write test scenarios and validate your code. Usually, when you are creating tests, we create a file for the test to validate the source code of another file. In that file, you can create a class that inherits from unittest.TestCase and has method names that contain the word test to be run on execution. You can record expectations through functions such as assertEquals and assertTrue, which are part of the base class, and you can, therefore, access them."

The folder where you work on the code is known as the source code tree, which is essentially how it is presented in the folder. This also contains Git files, configuration files, and others. The source distribution is a way to package our code so that it can be executed and installed on any machine—it just contains all the source code without any development-related files. A binary distribution is similar to source distribution, but it comes with the files ready to be installed on the system—there is no execution needed in the client host. Wheels are a particular standard for binary distributions that replace the old format, Python eggs. When we consume Python wheels we just get a file that is ready to be installed without the need of any compilation or build step, just ready to be consumed. This is especially useful for Python packages with C extensions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Additionally, to facilitate testing, many people consider it to be good practice to place all the source code of your package within an src directory. This is done to prevent the Python interpreter from automatically finding your package, as it is part of the current working directory, as Python adds the current working directory to the Python path. If your package contains any logic about the data files that are packaged with your code, you should really use the src directory, as it will force you to work against the installed version of your package, rather than the source directory tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyPA has recently created a guide on how to package projects, which contains further details than those discussed in this book.\n",

    "#### Creating Documentation the Easy Way\n",
    "A critical part of all software that is distributed across the world is documentation. Documentation allows the users of your code to be able to understand calling the different functions that we provide without having to read the code. There are multiple levels of documentation that you are going to explore in this topic. You will see how to write documentation that can be consumed in the console and on the web. In the purpose and size of our project, you should consider how broad our documentation should be and what kind of instructions and information it should contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Docstrings\n",
    "In Python, documentation is part of the language. When you declare a function, you can use docstrings to document its interface and behavior. Docstrings can be created by having a triple-quoted string block just after the function signature. This content is not only available to the reader but also to the user of the API, as it is part of a __doc__ attribute of the function, class, or module. It is the content that will be provided if we call the help function in the object passed. As an example, take a look at the contents of the __doc__ attribute of the print function:\n",

This is all really useful information for your users and even for ourselves when you have to use the code at a later time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Sphinx\n",
    "Using docstrings to document APIs is useful, but quite often you need something more. You want to generate a website with guides and other information about your library. In Python, the most common way to do this is via Sphinx. Sphinx allows you to generate documentation in multiple formats, such as PDF, epub, or html, easily from RST with some markup. Sphinx also comes with multiple plugins, and some of them are useful for Python, such as generating API documentation from docstrings or allowing you to view code behind the API implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed via pip, it comes with two main CLI scripts, which the user interacts with: sphinx-build and sphinx-quickstart. The first is used to build the documentation on an existing project with Sphinx configuration, while the second can be used to quickly bootstrap a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you bootstrap a project, Sphinx will generate multiple files for you, and the most important ones are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conf.py: This contains all the user configuration for generating the documentation. This is the most common place to look for configuration parameters when you want to customize something from the Sphinx output.\n",
    "- Makefile: An easy-to-use makefile that can be used to generate the documentation with a simple \"make html.\" There are other targets that can be useful, such as the one to run doctests.\n",
    "- Index.rst: The main entry point for our documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, most projects create a folder named docs within their source tree root to contain everything related to the documentation and Sphinx. This folder can then refer to the source code by either installing it or by adding it to the path in their configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar with RST, it is best to have a quick look through sphinx-doc.org. It has a short explanation of the different special syntaxes you can find in RST that will be translated into special HTML tags such as links, anchors, tables, images, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of this, Sphinx is easily extendible via plugins. Some of them are part of the default distribution when you install sphinx. Plugins allow you to extend the functionality to do things such as automatically create documentation for your modules, classes, and functions by just writing a single directive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are multiple themes available when you generate documentation with Sphinx—these are all configurable in conf.py. Quite often, you can find more Sphinx themes available on PyPI, which can be just installed easily via pip."

    "#### More Complex Documentation\n",
    "In the previous exercise, you examined simple documentation for a really small module. Most libraries also include tutorials and guides along with their API documentation. Check Django, flask, or CPython as examples, as they are all generated with Sphinx.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you intend our library to be used extensively and successfully, then documentation will be a key part of it. When you want to document how an API behaves, you should use just the plain API documentation that you generated before. However, there is also room to create small guides for specific features or tutorials to walk users through the most common steps to start a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there are tools such as readthedocs, which greatly simplifies the generation and hosting of documentation. You can take the project that we just generated and connect it to readthedocs through their UI to have our documentation hosted on the web and automatically regenerated every time you update the master branch of our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You can go to readthedocs.org to create an account and set up your repositories in GitHub to automatically generate documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Source Management\n",
    "When you work with code, you need a way in which to keep a picture of how your code evolves and how changes are being applied to different files. For instance, say that, by mistake, you make changes to your code that suddenly breaks it, or you start to make changes and just want to go back to the previous version. Many people start with just copying their source code into different folders and naming them with a timestamp based on checkpoints they make on different phases of the project. This is the most rudimentary approach to version control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is the system by which you keep control of code as it evolves over time. Developers have been suffering for long enough to create a piece of software that can do this job efficiently, and one of the most popular tools to do this is a Git. Git is a Distributed Version Control System that allows developers to manage their code locally as it evolves, look at the history, and easily collaborate with other developers. Git is used to manage some of the biggest projects around the world, such as the Windows kernel, CPython, Linux, or Git itself; however, at the same time, git is really useful and versatile for small projects as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Repository\n",
    "A repository is an isolated workspace where you can work with your changes and have git record them and track the history of them. One repository can contain as many files and folders as you want, with all of them tracked by git.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to create a repository: you can either clone an existing repository by using git clone (url of the repository>), which will bring a local copy of a repository into your current path, or you can create a repository from an existing folder with git init, which will just mark the folder as a repository by creating the necessary files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a repository locally created, you can start to work with our version control system by issuing different commands to indicate whether you want to add changes, check previous versions, or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Commit\n",
    "A commit object is the history of our repository. Each repository has many commits: one for every time we use git commit. Each of those commits will contain the commit title, the person who added the commit to the repository, the author of the changes, the dates when the commit and the changes were made, an ID that is represented by a hash, and the hash of the parent commit. With this, you can create a tree of all the commits within the repository, which allows us to see the history of our source code. You can see the content of any commit by running git show <(commit sha>).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run git commit, we create a commit from all the changes that you have in the staging area. An editor will open, which includes some meta-information such as the title and the commit body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A good guide on how to write good commit messages can be found here. You suggest that you take a look after finishing this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Staging Area\n",
    "When you are working locally, making changes to our files and source code, git will report that those changes happened, and they are not saved. By running git status, you can see what files were modified. If you decide that we want to save those changes in the staging area in preparation for a commit, you can add them with the git add <(path>) command. It can be used in files or folders to add all the files within that folder. Once they are added to the staging area, the next git commit command will save the changes in the repository through a commit object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you don't want to add all the contents of a file to the staging area, just part of them. For this use case, both git commit and git add have an option to guide you through the different changes in the file and allow you to select which ones you want to add. This is through the -p option, which will ask you for each of the changed chunks within your code, which ones you do want to add.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Undoing Local Changes\n",
    "When you are working on a file, you can run git diff to see all the changes that have been made locally but are not yet part of the staging area or a commit. Sometimes, you realize we want to undo our changes and come back to the version you have saved in the staging area or in the last commit. You can do this by checking out the file by running git checkout <path)>. This applies to both files and folders. Alternatively, you can remove all local changes by git stash.\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead, you want to revert our repository back to a previous commit in history, you can do this by running git reset <(commit sha>).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### History\n",
    "As you mentioned before, the repository has a commit history. This includes all the commits that have been performed before. You can see them by running git log, which will present you with the title, body, and some other information. The most important part of each of these entries is the sha of the commit, which uniquely represents each of the commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ignoring Files\n",
    "When you work with our source code, we may find that, by running our program or any other action, you have files in your repository that you don't want git to track. In that scenario, you can use a special file that has to be placed at the top of the directory and named .gitignore, which can list all the files in glob patterns that you don't want git to track. This is especially handy for adding things such as IDE-generated files, compiled Python files, and more."

    "At its heart, membership of a programming team involves multiple people sharing their changes through git and ensuring that you are incorporating everybody else's changes when doing your own work.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways for people to work together using git. The developers of the Linux kernel each maintain their own repository and share potential changes over email, which they each choose whether to incorporate or not. Large companies, including Facebook and Google, use trunk-based development, in which all changes must be made on the main branch, usually called the \"master.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A common workflow popularized by support in the GitHub user interface is the pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the pull request workflow, you maintain your repository as a fork in GitHub of the canonical version from which software releases are made, often referred to as upstream or origin. You make a small collection of related changes, each representing progress toward a single bug fix or new feature, in a named branch on your own repository, which you push to your hosted repository with git push. When you are ready, you submit a pull request to the upstream repository. The team reviews these changes together in the pull request, and you add any further work needed to the branch. When the team is happy with the pull request, a supervisor or another developer merges it upstream, and the changes are \"pulled\" into the canonical version of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of the pull request workflow is that it's made easy by the user interface in applications such as Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab. The disadvantage comes from keeping those branches around while the pull request is being created and is under review. It's easy to fall behind as other work goes into the upstream repository, leaving your branch out of date and introducing the possibility that your change will conflict with some other changes, and those conflicts will need a resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with fresh changes and conflicts as they arise, rather than as a huge headache when it comes time to merge the pull request, you use git to fetch changes from the upstream repository, and either merge them into your branch or rebase your branch on the up-to-date upstream revision. Merging combines the history of commits on two branches and rebasing reapplies commits such that they start at the tip of the branch you are rebasing against. Your team should decide which of these approaches they prefer."

That means it's important that your team uses the same version of a library so that it works in the same way for all of them.\n",

    "#### Multiprocessing\n",
    "It's common to need to execute more than one thing in parallel in a modern software system. Machine learning programs and scientific simulations benefit from using the multiple cores available in a modern processor, dividing their work up between concurrent threads operating on the parallel hardware. Graphical user interfaces and network servers do their work \"in the background,\" leaving a thread available to respond to user events or new requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python itself uses multiple threads to do some work internally, which puts some limits on the ways in which a Python program can do multiprocessing. \n",

    "The three safest ways to work are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find a library that solves your problem and handles multiprocessing for you (which has been carefully tested).\n",
    "- Launch a new Python interpreter by running another copy of your script as a completely separate process.\n",
    "- Create a new thread within the existing interpreter to do some work concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these is the easiest and the most likely to be a success. The second is fairly simple and imposes the most overhead on your computer as the operating system is now running two independent Python scripts. The third is very complicated, easy to get wrong, and still creates a lot of overhead as Python maintains a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which means that only one thread at a time can interpret a Python instruction. A quick rule of thumb to choose between the three approaches is to always pick the first one. If a library doesn't exist to address your needs, then pick the second. If you absolutely need to share memory between the concurrent processes, or if your concurrent work is related to handling I/O, then you can choose the third carefully.\n",
