    "### The Importance of the Standard Library\n",
    "Python is often described as coming with \"batteries included,\" which is usually a reference to its standard library. The Python standard library is vast, unlike any other language in the tech world. The Python standard library includes modules to connect to a socket; that is, one to send emails, one to connect to SQLite, one to work with the locale module, or one to encode and decode JSON and XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also renowned for including such modules as turtle and tkinter, graphical interfaces that most users probably don't use anymore, but they have proven useful when Python is taught at schools and universities.\n",
    "\n",
    "It even includes IDLE, a Python-integrated development environment, it is not widely used as there are either other packages within the standard library that are used more often or external tools to substitute them. These libraries are divided into high-level modules and lower-level modules:"

    "The Python standard library is truly vast and diverse, providing a toolbelt for the user that can be used to write most of their trivial programs. You can open an interpreter and run the following code snippet to print graphics on the screen. This can be executed on the Python terminal. The code mentioned here is with the >>> symbol:\n",

    "#>>> turtle.right(90)\n",
    "#>>> turtle.forward(50)\n",
    "#>>> done()\n",
    "\n",
    "This code uses the turtle module which can be used to print the output on the screen. This output will look like the trail of a turtle that follows when the cursor is moved. The turtle module allows the user to interact with the cursor and leave a trail as it keeps moving. It has functions to move around the screen and print as it advances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a detailed explanation of the turtle module code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "It creates a turtle in the middle of the screen.\n",
    "It then rotates it 180 degrees to the right.\n",
    "It moves forward 100 pixels, painting as it walks.\n",
    "It then rotates to the right once again, this time by 90 degrees.\n",
    "It then moves forward 50 pixels once again.\n",
