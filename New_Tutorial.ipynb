    "### Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): \n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented programming is a widely used concept to write powerful applications. As a data scientist, you will be required to write applications to process your data, among a range of other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### OOP: Introduction\n",
    "Object-oriented programming has some advantages over other design patterns. Development is faster and cheaper, with better software maintainability. This, in turn, leads to higher-quality software, which is also extensible with new methods and attributes. The learning curve is, however, steeper. The concept may be too complex for beginners. Computationally, OOP software is slower, and uses more memory since more lines of code have to be written.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is based on the imperative programming paradigm, which uses statements to change a program's state. It focuses on describing how a program should operate. Examples of imperative programming languages are C, C++, Java, Go, Ruby and Python. This stands in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the computer program should accomplish, without specifying how. Examples are database query languages like SQL and XQuery, where one only tells the computer what data to query from where, but now how to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP uses the concept of objects and classes. A class can be thought of as a 'blueprint' for objects. These can have their own attributes (characteristics they possess), and methods (actions they perform).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### OOP Example\n",
    "An example of a class is the class Dog. Don't think of it as a specific dog, or your own dog. We're describing what a dog is and can do, in general. Dogs usually have a name and age; these are instance attributes. Dogs can also bark; this is a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you talk about a specific dog, you would have an object in programming: an object is an instantiation of a class. This is the basic principle on which object-oriented programming is based. So my dog Ozzy, for example, belongs to the class Dog. His attributes are name = 'Ozzy' and age = '2'. A different dog will have different attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### OOP in Python\n",
    "Python is a great programming language that supports OOP. You will use it to define a class with attributes and methods, which you will then call. Python offers a number of benefits compared to other programming languages like Java, C++ or R. It's a dynamic language, with high-level data types. This means that development happens much faster than with Java or C++. It does not require the programmer to declare types of variables and arguments. This also makes Python easier to understand and learn for beginners, its code being more readable and intuitive."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### How to create a class\n",
    "To define a class in Python, you can use the class keyword, followed by the class name and a colon. Inside the class, an __init__ method has to be defined with def. This is the initializer that you can later use to instantiate objects.  __init__ must always be present! It takes one argument: self, which refers to the object itself. Inside the method, the pass keyword is used as of now, because Python expects you to type something there. Remember to use correct indentation!"

It takes self, as per usual, and buddy as arguments. In this case, buddy will be another Dog object. Set the self.buddy attribute to buddy, and the buddy.buddy attribute to self. This means that the relationship is reciprocal; you are your buddy's buddy. In this case, Filou will be Ozzy's buddy, which means that Ozzy automatically becomes Filou's buddy. You could also set these attributes manually, instead of defining a method, but that would require more work (writing 2 lines of code instead of 1) every time you want to set a buddy. Notice that in Python, you don't need to specify of what type the argument is. If this were Java, it would be required."
